# üîã Multiphysics Simulation and State Estimation of a Prismatic Li-Ion Battery Pack

This project focuses on the design, simulation, and analysis of a 6S1P prismatic lithium-ion battery pack. The work integrates mechanical, thermal, and electrical modeling to assess the structural integrity, thermal efficiency, and battery health metrics like SOC (State of Charge) and SOH (State of Health). The ultimate goal is to create a validated digital twin that supports safer and more efficient battery system designs.
